# TSP_TravelingSalesmanProblem
This project implements several algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The project includes implementations for algorithms such as A*, BFS, and UCS, as well as a module for computing heuristics.

## Project Structure
* **astar.py**: Implementation of the A* algorithm for TSP.
* **bfs.py**: Implementation of the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm for TSP.
* **heuristics.py**: Calculation of heuristics used by the algorithms.
* **input**: The input file containing the input data for the problem.
* **io_utils.py**: Utility functions for reading and writing input and output data.
* **main.py**: Entry point of the application, where the algorithms are initialized and run.
* **output**: The output file where the results are stored.
* **tsp.py**: The main implementation of the TSP problem.
* **ucs.py**: Implementation of the uniform-cost search (UCS) algorithm for TSP.
